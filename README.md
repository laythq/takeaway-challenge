This is a takeaway application that allows you to:

- see a list of items (#show_menu)
- add an item to your order (#add_item(item))
- calculate the sum total of your order (#calculate_sum)
- and finally to place an order (#place_order). Placing an order will send a text message to the user confirming the order has been placed and giving an estimated time of arrival

The text message feature is provided by the Twilio API.
